    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="para">Hi! Iam Aiswarya, a B.Tech Computer Science 2nd-year student at the<br> Federal Institute of Science and Technology (FISAT). I enjoy creating-<br>whether it is video edits, clean and simple designs, or small tech projects<br> that help me learn something new.

Iam not a professional editor or designer,<br> but I genuinely love exploring tools, understanding how things work, and<br> improving with every project. I like keeping things minimal and visually neat,<br> and I enjoy learning through experimenting, building, and trying out ideas that<br> interest me.

Iam still growing and figuring out my direction, but I love the process<br> of learning, creating, and becoming better step by step.</p>
